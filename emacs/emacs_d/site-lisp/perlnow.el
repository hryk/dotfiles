 "The introductory documentation to the perlnow.el package.
Also see the documentation for:
`perlnow-documentation-installation'
`perlnow-documentation-terminology'
`perlnow-documentation-template-expansions'
`perlnow-documentation-tutorial'
`perlnow-documentation-test-file-strategies'

This package is intended to speed development of perl code,
largely by making it easier to jump into coding when an idea
strikes. It also includes some commands to help automate some routine
development tasks including testing the code in the emacs environment.

A perlnow command will typically prompt for a location and/or name,
open a file buffer with an appropriate framework already inserted
\(e.g. the hash-bang line, comments including date and author
information, a perldoc outline, and so on\).  In the case of scripts
the file automatically becomes executable.

Many of the perlnow.el features require that template.el
package has been installed, along with some templates for
perl development purposes. See `perlnow-documentation-installation'.

Primarily, perlnow.el provides the following interactive
functions:

\\[perlnow-script] - for creation of new perl scripts.  If
currently viewing some perl module code or a man page for a
perl module, this begins the script with a few lines to use
the module.

\\[perlnow-script-simple] - an older, not quite deprecated
form of \\[perlnow-script] that has the virtue of not
needing template.el to operate.

\\[perlnow-module] - for creation of new modules.  Asks for
the location and name of the new module in a single prompt,
using a hybrid form: \"/usr/lib/perl/Some::Module\"

\\[perlnow-object-module] - for creation of new OOP modules.
Much like perlnow-module, but uses a different template.

\\[perlnow-h2xs] - runs the h2xs command, to begin working
on a new module for distribution, such as via CPAN.

\\[perlnow-run-check] - does a perl syntax check on the
current buffer, displaying error messages and warnings in
the standard emacs style, so that the next-error command,
\(usually bound to control-x back-apostrophe\)
will skip you to the location of the problem.

\\[perlnow-run] - like the above, except that it actually
tries to run the code, prompting the user for a run string
it if it has not been defined yet.

\\[perlnow-set-run-string] - Allows the user to manually
change the run-string used by perlnow-run.

\\[perlnow-perldb] - runs the perl debugger using the above run string.


\\[perlnow-alt-run] - works just like \\[perlnow-run]
except that it uses the \"alt-run-string\" rather than
the \"run-string\".

\\[perlnow-set-alt-run-string] - Allows the user to manually
change the alt-run-string used by perlnow-alt-run.



A list of the important functions that require template.el:
\\[perlnow-script]
\\[perlnow-module]
\\[perlnow-object-module]
\\[perlnow-module-two-questions]

Many useful functions here don't need template.el.
Briefly these are:
\\[perlnow-run-check]
\\[perlnow-run]
\\[perlnow-set-run-string]
\\[perlnow-h2xs]
\\[perlnow-script-simple] \(older alternate to \\[perlnow-script]\)
\\[perlnow-perlify-this-buffer-simple] \(an even older alternate\)")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-installation t
  "Instructions on installation of the perlnow package.

Put the perlnow.el file somewhere that's included in your `load-path'.

Also install template.el if at all possible, because
many \(but not all\) features of this package depend on
template.el.  The latest version can be found at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47369

In addition, you'll need some custom perl-oriented
template.el templates that come with perlnow.el.  Most
likely these templates should go in your ~/.templates,
\(note they end with: '.tpl'\).  If you've somehow obtained
the perlnow.el file without the associated templates,
you can look for copies of them here:

   http://obsidianrook.com/perlnow/

Add something like the following to your ~/.emacs file:

   \(require 'template\)
   \(template-initialize\)
   \(require 'perlnow\)

  \(setq `perlnow-script-location'
      \(substitute-in-file-name \"$HOME/bin\"\)\)
  \(setq `perlnow-pm-location'
      \(substitute-in-file-name \"$HOME/lib\"\)\)\n
  \(setq `perlnow-h2xs-location''
      \(substitute-in-file-name \"$HOME/perldev\"\)\)\n

   \(perlnow-define-standard-keymappings\)

If you prefer, that last function can be broken out into 
individual definitions like so \(this would make it easier 
for you to modify them to suit yourself\):

   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/s\" 'perlnow-script\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/m\" 'perlnow-module\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/o\" 'perlnow-object-module\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/h\" 'perlnow-h2xs\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/c\" 'perlnow-run-check\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/r\" 'perlnow-run\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/a\" 'perlnow-alt-run\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/d\" 'perlnow-perldb\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/R\" 'perlnow-set-run-string\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/A\" 'perlnow-set-alt-run-string\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/t\" 'perlnow-edit-test-file\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/b\" 'perlnow-back-to-code\)
   \(global-set-key \"\\C-c/~\" 'perlnow-perlify-this-buffer-simple\)


Some suggestions on key assignments:

Here I'm using the odd prefix \"control-c slash\",
simply because while the perlnow.el package is not a
minor-mode, it has some aspects in common with them \(and
maybe it's on it's way to becoming one\).  The C-c
<punctuation> bindings are the only places in the keymap 
allocated for minor modes. The slash was choosen
because it's unshifted and on the opposite side from the 
\"c\" \(on most keyboards\) .

You, on the other hand, are free to do whatever you want in
your .emacs, and you might prefer other assignments, such 
as using function keys for frequently used commands.  
Some possibilities:

  \(global-set-key [f4] 'perlnow-script\)

  \(add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook
          '\(lambda \(\)
             \(define-key cperl-mode-map [f1] 'perlnow-perl-check\) \)\)

Note: perlnow.el was developed using GNU emacs 21.1 running
on a linux box \(or GNU/Linux, if you prefer\).  I've
avoided using constructs that I know won't work with earlier
versions of emacs, and I don't know of any reason it
wouldn't work with xemacs, but none of that has been tested.
On the other hand, I'm pretty sure that some unix-isms have
crept into this code: for example, if your file-system
expects a \"\\\" as a separator between levels, this package
may have some problems.  I'm amenable to suggestions for
ways to make future versions more portable.")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-terminology t
  "Definitions of some terms used here:

Note: I make the simplifying assumption that a perl package
is a perl module is a single file, \(with extension *.pm\).
Even though technically multiple packages can occur in a
single file, that is not done often in practice.

Why is there such a mess of terminology below?
Because there's a file system name space and a module name space:

   /usr/lib/perl/Modular/Stuff.pm
   /usr/lib/perl/ Modular::Stuff

This makes the answers to simple questions ambiguous:
What is the module called? Stuff.pm or Modular::Stuff?
Where is the module? /usr/lib/perl/Modular or /usr/lib/perl?

The following terms are used here in an attempt at being
more precise:

PM FILE \(or MODULE FILENAME\): the file system's name for
the module file, e.g. /usr/lib/perl/Modular/Stuff.pm

MODULE FILE BASENAME: name of the module file itself, sans
extension: in the above example, \"Stuff\"

PM LOCATION \(or MODULE FILE LOCATION\): directory
portion of module file name, e.g. /usr/lib/perl/Modular/

MODULE NAME or PACKAGE NAME: perl's double colon separated
name, e.g. \"Modular::Stuff\"

INC SPOT: a place where perl's package space begins
\(e.g. /usr/lib/perl\). Perl's @INC is a list of different
such \"inc spots\" \(alternate term: \"module root\" or
\"package root\"\).

STAGING AREA: the directory created by the h2xs command
for module development, a hyphenized-form of the module name
e.g. Modular-Stuff. Staging areas often contain a module root
\(or \"inc spot\") called \"lib\".

H2XS LOCATION: the place where you put your staging areas

PERLISH PATH: this means a module path including double
colons \(alternate term: \"colon-ized\"\),

FILE SYSTEM PATH \(or FILESYS PATH\): as opposed to
\"perlish\".  This is the regular \'nix style slash
separated path.

FULL: usually meaning that the full path is included,
e.g. \"full file name\".

TEST SCRIPT: The *.t file associated with the current
module/script\(?\), usually something like ModuleName.t or
possibly Staging-Area.t.

TEST LOCATION: place where the test script\(s\) are for
a given module.

TEST PATH: search path to look for test files. Note, can
include relative locations, e.g. \"./t\", but the the dot
there shouldn't be taken as simply the current
directory... See: `perlnow-test-path'.

TEST POLICY: the information necessary to know where to
put a newly created test file and what to call it:
1 - the test path dot form, e.g. \"./t\";
2 - the definition of dot e.g. module-file-location vs. inc-spot;
3 - the naming style, e.g. hyphenized vs. base.")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-tutorial t
  "Well, first you install it: `perlnow-documentation-installation'.
Then what?

Depending on how you configure things, you should then have
easy access (perhaps as easy as a single keystroke of a
function key) to some quick short-cuts.  Here's a run down
on how you might use them for different purposes:

 `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-1-script-development'
 `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-2-module-development'
 `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-3-h2xs-module-development'
 `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-4-misc'
 `perlnow-documentation-test-file-strategies'")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-tutorial-1-script-development t
  "Got an idea for a script?  Hit \\[perlnow-script].

This will ask you for the name of the script you want to
write, then kick you into a file buffer with a recommended
code template already filled in.

If you don't like the template, change it \(it should be in
your ~/.templates directory\).  For example, you might
prefer to have \"use strict;\" appear commented out but
ready to be enabled when you know the script is going to be
longer than a dozen lines.

Currently perlnow-script tends to want to put all of your
new scripts in one place, the `perlnow-script-location' that
you've defined for it.  You can, of course, choose a
different place to put a script at creation time, the
default is inserted into the minibuffer so that you can use
it as a starting point to edit into some new location.
Similarly you've also got access to the minibuffer history
to get other starting places.

\(By the way: you do know about the minibuffer history,
don't you?  I didn't until recently.  During a minibuffer
read, you can step back and forth through the history of
things you've entered using: \\[previous-history-element]
and \\[next-history-element]. Typically these are bound to
Alt-p and Alt-n.\)

But every time you use \\[perlnow-script] it's going to try
and put it in the same default location, so \(a\) try and
pick a good default, and \(b\) think about changing it on
the fly if you're going to do a lot of work in a different
place.  You can use \\[set-variable] to set
`perlnow-script-location'.

Okay, so once you're in your new perl script buffer, you can
start coding away.  At any time, you can do a perlnow-run-check
to make sure your syntax is okay.

Note that if you take nothing else away from messing with
the perlnow.el package, you owe it to yourself to grab this
perlnow-run-check command.  Don't get hung-up on any
installation hassles you might run into, don't tell yourself
\"maybe I'll play with that someday after I finish reading
all that long-winded documentation\", if need be just grab
that half-dozen lines of elisp and cut and paste it into
your .emacs.  If you haven't messed with something like this
before, you will be stunned and amazed at the convenience of
coding inside of emacs.  All perlnow-run-check does is act
as a wrapper around the emacs compile-command facility,
feeding in the \"perl -cw\" command.  Once you do the check,
the errors and warnings will be listed in another buffer,
and doing a \"next-error\" will rotate you through these,
skipping you directly to the point in the code where the
problem was reported.  Typically you run \"next-error\"
with a control-x back-apostrophe, randomly enough.
It looks like your binding is: \\[next-error]

But as cool as \\[perlnow-run-check] is, you could skip it if
you like, and go straight to \\[perlnow-run], which will
\(the first time through\) then ask you how you want to
run the script. The default command line is just
\"perl <scriptname>\"; but you can append whatever
arguments and re-directs you like.  Once a run-string
is defined for that file buffer it will stop asking you
this question, though you can change the run string later
at any time with \\[perlnow-set-run-string].

Every time you do a \\[perlnow-run] it behaves much like
doing a \\[perlnow-run-check]: any problems will be reported
in another buffer \(mixed in with the output from the
program\), once again letting you do the \\[next-error]
trick to jump to where you need to be.

By the way, you might notice I've said nothing about
stopping to do a \"chmod u+x\" to make the script
executable.  That's because \\[perlnow-script] does this for you.
Admittedly, this feature is less impressive than it used to
be in these emacs 21 days, when you can just put this in
your .emacs:

  \\(add-hook 'after-save-hook
    'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p\\)

When you run into a problem nasty enough to want to use the
debugger, I suggest using \\[perlnow-perldb], rather than
\\[perldb] directly.  The perlnow wrapper uses the
`perlnow-run-string' you've defined, which will be different
for each script.  If you use the perldb command directly,
you'll notice that the default is just however you ran it
last.  If you're switching back and forth between working on
two scripts, that default is going to be wrong a lot.

The next subject, developing perl modules:
  `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-2-module-development'")


(defvar perlnow-documentation-tutorial-2-module-development t
   "When you're interested in writing a module, the procedure
is similar to script development:
  `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-1-script-development'

You have your choice of three ways of beginning work 
on a new module:

For proceedural modules:       \\[perlnow-module]
For object-oriented modules:   \\[perlnow-object-module]
For h2xs (cpan) modules:       \\[perlnow-h2xs]

The first two are very similar, they just use a different
template (the OOP version is simpler, there being no need
for use Exporter there).  Both ask you for the name and
location of the module you want to create in a single
prompt, asking for an answer in a hybrid form like:

  /home/hacker/perldev/lib/New::Module

Here the module location \(really, a \"module root\"
location, or \"inc spot\", see `perlnow-documentation-terminology')
is entered in the usual file-system form \(in this example,
it is \"/home/hacker/perldev/lib/\"\) and the module name
is given using perl's double-colon separated package name notation
\(in this example, \"New::Module\"\).

The default for the module location is given by the variable
`perlnow-pm-location' which should be set in
your .emacs as indicated in `perlnow-documentation-installation'.
It can also be modified on the fly with \\[set-variable].

Tab and space completion works while navigating the previously
existing part of the path \(including the part inside the package
name space\).  When you hit enter, it will create whatever
intervening directories it needs, after first prompting to make sure
it's okay \(note, I'm a little dubious of that prompt: it may
disappear in future versions\).

Now I have worked long and hard on getting this single-prompt
method of entering this information, and I'm very proud of
it, and I think it's wonderfully elegant, so the way
these things go the odds are good that you will hate it.

If so, you can use the older form of this command,
\\[perlnow-module-two-questions].  It gets the same information,
but does it by asking a separate question for where and what.
Auto-completion works on the \"where\" question, but not at all
for the module name.

Note that one of the advantages of the \\[perlnow-run-check]
command for doing syntax checks is that it works on module
code just as well as on scripts: you don't need to have a
method of running the module to clean up the syntactical bugs.

If you do a \\[perlnow-run] it will \(a\) perform an
elaborate search to try and find a test file for the module
then \(b\) ask you for the name of a script to run that uses
the module.  Unless you're some kind of sick and twisted
extreme programming freak, the odds are pretty good you
won't have either, yet.  So before doing that
\\[perlnow-run], you have your choice of \\[perlnow-script]
or if you *are* a test-first-code-later fanatic,
\\[perlnow-edit-test-file].  Both will get you started on
writing a script that uses the module.  Both of them 
will create files with a \"use <module name>\" line filled in.  
If the module is not in your @INC search path, it will also
add the necessary \"FindBin/use lib\" magic to make sure
that the script will be able to find the module.

If you skip back to the original module buffer, and do a \\[perlnow-run],
you'll notice that the script you just created has become the default
for the way the code in the module gets run.

Another little gimmick hidden away here, is that you should find
that the name of whatever perl \"sub\" the cursor happened to
have been near has been pushed on to the kill-ring.  You can just
do a \\[yank] if you've got some use for it.

But remember in order for that sub to be accessible, you
might need to do some chores like add the sub name to the
module's EXPORT_TAGS list, and then add it to a qw() list
appended to the \"use <package-name>\" inside the
script.

Currently the perlnow.el package is a little light on
features to smooth/sleaze your way past those obstacles \(we
do Have Plans, however\), but you might like to know that
the module template provided with perlnow puts some useful
locations in the numeric registers.  So you can quickly jump
to these positions with the emacs command
\\[jump-to-register], e.g. \(presuming the default
bindings\), doing a \"control x r j 9\" will take you to the
point stored in register 9.

Here's the count-down:

   register    position
   9           EXPORT_TAGS

   6           DESCRIPTION

Next, the h2xs approach to module development:
  `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-3-h2xs-module-development'")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-tutorial-3-h2xs-module-development t
  "There's another completely different style of perl module development,
from the one discussed in: `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-2-module-development';
the h2xs module approach, which is intended to be used for modules
which will be published on CPAN.  This of course, involves using the
standard framework created by the h2xs command, and for your
convenience the perlnow package provides: \\[perlnow-h2xs].

This will ask you two questions, \(1\) where do you want to
put the staging area that h2xs creates, and \(2\) what do you
want to call this module.  The first question defaults to the
customizable variable `perlnow-h2xs-location'

\(Aside: my feeling is that asking two questions for the
creation of an h2xs structure, vs. the one question hybrid
form used by \\[perlnow-module] is okay.  It helps
differentiate it from \\[perlnow-module], and in any case it
doesn't logically lend itself to a single question form.  In
the case of h2xs the \"where?\" is the staging-area, not the
module root.  The module root is located inside a \"lib\"
directory inside the staging-area, so there's a gap between
the \"where\" and the \"what\", and we might as well represent
that gap as the gap between the two questions.\)

Anyway, after you answer the two questions, \[perlnow-h2xs]
will run the h2xs command, and then leave you with two windows
open, one showing the module file buffer, the other showing the
test file for the module.

One of the nice features of the h2xs style of development is
the standard test framework.  This still defaults to a simple
\"use Test;\" though the wave of the future is probably
Test::More.  You should familiarize yourself with
at least one of these.

If you do a \\[perlnow-run] inside of an h2xs module, it will
identify it as h2xs, and use \"make test\" as the run string.
\(Though actually, the first time you do this, if \"perl
Makefile.PL\" hasn't been run yet, it should do that first.\).

Next, everyone's favorite subject, \"Misc\":
 `perlnow-documentation-tutorial-4-misc'")


(defvar perlnow-documentation-tutorial-4-misc t
  "Misc topic 1 - starting from man:

A typical 'nix-style box these days will have the documentation for
perl modules installed as man pages, which can be most simply read
from inside of emacs with the \\[man] command.

  If you happen to be browsing some perl module
documentation in an emacs man window, you might suddenly be
struck by the urge to try it out in a script.  If so you
should know that the \\[perlnow-script] command is
smart enough \(*knock* *knock*\) to pick out the module name
from a man page buffer. This should kick you into a script
template with the \"use <package-name>\" line already filled in.

\(By the way, the perldoc.el package looks like a promising
alternative to running \\[man], but it seems to just act as
a front-end to the man command... since you end up in the
same kind of buffer, the \\[perlnow-script] command
will work with that also.\)

Misc topic 2 - perlify:

In addition to the old-style non-template.el fallback:
\\[perlnow-script-simple], there's another command
that's somewhat similar called: \\[perlnow-perlify-this-buffer-simple].
The \"perlify\" concept is that you can use whatever
habits you're used to to begin working on a script \(e.g.
go into dired, choose a directory, choose a file name
and open it there\), and *then* you can run \"perlify\"
and insert a simple code template and make the file executable.

Originally I found that approach to be a little easier to get
used to than the \\[perlnow-script] approach, but
pretty quickly I abandoned it and switched over.

Note that template.el plus a good perl template, plus that
new emacs 21 trick for making scripts executable
automatically all gets you very close to having this
functionality without any help from perlnow.el... except for
one little gotcha: most of us do not use a standard file
extension (like '.pl') on our perl scripts.  That makes it a
little hard for template.el to spot that you're creating
one.  Though if you can get into the habit of doing a
\\[template-new-file] instead of \\[find-file], and don't
mind selecting the correct template after you enter the file
name then you're pretty much there.

Misc topic 3 - the \"alternative\" way of running a script:

With version 0.3, perlnow.el now includes a way to
have easy access to two different ways of running some code.
In addition to the commands \\[perlnow-run] and
\\[set-perlnow-run-string] commands there are now
\\[perlnow-alt-run] and \\[set-perlnow-alt-run-string].
The \"alt-run\" commands behave identically to the \"run\"
commands, but they use a different buffer-local variable
to store the run string.  The developer can then do
things like use the \\[perlnow-alt-run] command to run
a general regression test for an entire module, but
use \\[perlnow-run] to run a small test that just exercises
whatever feature is currently under development.
It's often useful to have a simple, fast-running test
that you use frequently, and a more through battery
of tests on which you can allow a run time of several 
minutes because you don't use it as often.

Note that if you need to switch between more than two
run strings, there's always the minibuffer \"history\"
features:  \\[previous-history-element] and
\\[next-history-element] which in-context, you will
typically find bound to Alt-p and Alt-n.")


(defvar perlnow-documentation-test-file-strategies t
  "As mentioned in a few other places, the \\[perlnow-run]
and \\[set-perlnow-run-string] commands try to find
appropriate test files for perl code buffers.  
There's a relatively elaborate search path for this.  Here's
a quick description of what it looks for before giving up
and prompting the user \(but please, avoid relying on the
precedence of this search as currently implemented: it may
change\):

First of all, test files all end with the \".t\" extension
\(just as with h2xs test files\).  There are two possibilities
for the name of the basename of the test file, \(1\) it might
just be the same as the base name for the \".pm\" file itself,
or it might be a \"hyphenized\" form of the module's package
name \(like an h2xs staging area name\).  For example, in the
case of \"Modular::Silliness\", the name might be \"Silliness.t\",
or \"Modular-Silliness.t\".

Secondly, a test file might be located in the same place
that a module file is located, or it may be located in the
module root location where the module's package name space
starts, or it might be tucked away in a directory called
\"t\" which could be located in either of those places.

This means that there are a number of strategies you might
choose to use for perl module test files that should
work well with perlnow.el. \(And some of them are even
reasonable.  And some of them are already in use in industry.
And there's even some overlap between those two sets.\)

An example of a good practice would be to always use the
hyphenized base name form, and always put test files in a
directory called \"t\", a subdirectory of the place where
\".pm\" file is located.

So if you've got a module called \"Modular::Silliness\", which
is really the file: ~/perldev/lib/Modular/Silliness.pm
For a test file, you could use:

  ~/perldev/lib/Modular/t/Modular-Silliness.t

If you don't like that you can use any of these schemes:

  ~/perldev/lib/t/Modular-Silliness.t
  ~/perldev/lib/Modular/t/Silliness.t
  ~/perldev/lib/Modular-Silliness.t
  ~/perldev/lib/Modular/Silliness.t
  ~/perldev/t/Modular-Silliness.t

The ones you probably don't want to use are these:
  ~/perldev/lib/t/Silliness.t
  ~/perldev/lib/Silliness.t
  ~/perldev/t/Silliness.t

\(There's too much potential for name collisions, if you use
the short \"basename\" form high up in the tree. Modular::Silliness
and Monolithic::Silliness would fight to use the same name.\)

Note that perlnow \(at least currently\) does not care if you're
consistent about this choice, but for your own sanity you should
probably pick a standard way of doing it and stick to it.

However, there is now (as of version 0.3) a \\[perlnow-edit-test-file] 
command that will create a new test file if one does not already exist.  
The user defineable \"test policy\" dictates where these new
test files will go.  See \"test policy\" in
`perlnow-documentation-terminology'.")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-unashamed-deviancy t
  "There are a number of areas where I'm aware of deviating from
standard and/or recommended practice.  In a vain attempt
at forestalling criticism, I'm going to list them:

On variables such as `perlnow-script-run-string', I've
used \\[make-variable-buffer-local] in preference to the
recommended \\[make-local-variable].  I personally always
want these variables to be buffer local, and I have trouble
thinking of a reason that the user would want them otherwise.
It's much more convenient to use make-variable-buffer-local
right after they're defined, and to not have to worry about it
later.

In minibuffer input, I typically define an \"initial\"
string rather than a \"default\", because an initial string
is easily and obviously editable.  It's a good point that
the newer minibuffer history features get you much of the
same functionality, but they're not terribly obvious (personally,
I've only just realized that they were there, and I've been
an emacs user for quite a long time).  The claim that
defaults are better than initial values because they're less
\"intrusive\" strikes me as a relatively abstruse issue
in comparison.

It would probably be better if perlnow were a global minor-mode
with a set of built-in keymappings, but for now I've decided to
punt, and just instruct the user to add them to their global
key map in their .emacs file.  \(Whenever I research the issue,
my eyes begin to glaze over... if you'd care to join me, see
the ramblings in \\[perlnow-documentation-to-mode-or-not-to-mode] \).

Similarly, rather than master the intricacies of texinfo, I'm
copping out and entering documentation as variable docstrings
such as this.  I picked up this idea from looking at IZ's
cperl-mode, and I expect it appeals to me for the same reason
it appeals to him: we're perl programmers, and we're used to
\"pod\".

I've adopted the practice of inserting horizontal rules
between my function definitions (as suggested in a style
guide written by the tinytools folks), because this makes it
possible to use white space between chunks of code within
the defuns without confusing things.  My comment style remains
strongly influenced by perl culture \(many elisp people seem
to think it's possible to write \"self-documenting\" code...\).

Oh, and one last set of issues: for now I'm completely
ignoring the newer emacs features for menubars and
the \"customize\" facility, because I don't know anything
about them.  I never use them.  I'm a \(menu-bar-mode -1\) kind-of guy.
Not to mention: \(scroll-bar-mode -1\) and \(tool-bar-mode -1\).")

(defvar perlnow-documentation-to-mode-or-not-to-mode t
  "Should perlnow.el become a minor mode?

This is an issue I keep noodling around: perlnow.el
is designed to work with other modes, and it needs to have
a default keymap, so that would seem to imply it should
be a minor-mode.

It has to make some assignments to the global keymap,
because the main purpose of the package is to make it easy
to jump into perl programming whatever the current mode
happens to be.  So that might imply it should be a global
minor-mode.

But some perlnow commands are only needed inside of a perl code
buffer \(e.g. \\[perlnow-run] and \\[perlnow-run-check]\)
and could reasonably be kept local to your perl mode \(slight
complication: there are two perl modes\).

So perhaps perlnow.el should be a combination of the two, a
global and a local minor-mode, \(implemented in one .el
package?\).

Further, it's possible that I might add some other commands that should
be local to still *other* modes, for example a perlnow-script-from-dired
might create a perlscript in the location displayed in a current dired
buffer.  So does that imply yet another sub-local-minor-mode?

Eh, I've punted on this for now.  It doesn't help that the Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual is a little light on examples of how to do global
minor-modes.

In general, it's not entirely clear to me how minor-modes are supposed
to play together nicely.  The segment of the keymap available for
minor-mode usage is pretty small \(C-c [punctuation], and not just any
punctuation either\).  I would think you could easily run into situations
where the order in which you load minor-modes would change the keymappings
you end up with.

By the way, if you go looking for a good prefix of your own to attach
\"perl\" stuff like the perlnow commands, consider that \"C-x p\" is
used by the p4.el package \(a front-end to the perforce version control
package -- which is proprietary, but still widely used\), and you
should be aware that \"M-p\" is used in many contexts for \"history\"
navigation.  On the other hand, *most* of the places that \"M-p\" is
defined are not places that you'd probably want to issue a perlnow
command -- the one exception I can think of is in a *shell* buffer, so
you might want to be daring and experiment with grabbing Alt-p for your
own use.")

  "The perlnow template.el templates use some custom
expansions defined in perlnow.el.  A template.el
\"expansion\" is a place holder in the template that
gets replaced by something else when the template is
used.  For example, \(>>>DATE<<<\) will become the
current date.

The perlnow custom expansions:

\(>>>EMAIL_DOT_EMACS<<<\)
This inserts the users email address as determined from
their .emacs setting of the variable `user-mail-address'.

\(>>>PERL_MODULE_NAME<<<\)
becomes the perl module name \(in double-colon
separated form\) when used by \\[perlnow-module]
function.

\(>>>PERL_SCRIPT_NAME<<<\)
becomes the perl script name of the previous
current buffer.  Used in creating test scripts 
that need to refer to the current script. 

\(>>>MINIMUM_PERL_VERSION<<<\)
The minimum perl version you usually support.  Gets used in
the first line in a perl module, e.g. \"use 5.006;\".
Used by \\[perlnow-module] to insert the value of
`perlnow-minimum-perl-version'.

\(>>>TAB<<<\)
Experimental feature: should indent as though the tab
key had been hit.  I suspect that you need to use
\(>>>TAB<<<\) *after* the line of code and not before.

\(>>>PNFS<<<\)
stands for \"PerlNow Filename Spaces\" it should
always insert the same number of spaces as characters
in the name of the file.  This is a gross kludge
which can be used to get formatting to line up, for example:
   \(>>>FILE<<<\)              \(>>>AUTHOR<<<\)
   \(>>>PNFS<<<\)              \(>>>DATE<<<\)
Note the utility of having \"PNFS\" be four characters,
the same length as \"FILE\".  Like I said: a gross kludge.

Some experimental, alternative gross kludges:

\(>>>EMAIL_AT_45<<<\)
This moves to column 45 before inserting the user email address
\(as understood by emacs, typically from a .emacs file setting\)

Note that this will obediently over-write anything else that might
already be in that area.

\(>>>TIMESTAMP_AT_45<<<\)
This moves to column 45 before inserting the timestamp
returned by current-time-string.
Note that this will obediently over-write anything else that might
already be in that area.

See `template-expansion-alist' for the current list of
defined expansions.")
